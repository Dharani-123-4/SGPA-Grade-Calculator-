# SGPA-Grade-Calculator-
To calculate SGPA(Semester Grade Point Average), you need the grades and corresponding credit hours for each subject. Here's an example of how to fill out the form and the steps to calculate the SGPA:

### Example Input:
- Subject 1: Grade = 8, Credits = 4
- Subject 2: Grade = 7, Credits = 3
- Subject 3: Grade = 9, Credits = 3
- Subject 4: Grade = 6, Credits = 2
- Subject 5: Grade = 8, Credits = 3
- Subject 6: Grade = 7, Credits = 3
- Subject 7: Grade = 10, Credits = 1
- Subject 8: Grade = 9, Credits = 2

### Steps to Calculate SGPA:
1. *Multiply each grade by the corresponding credits*:
   - Subject 1: \(8 \times 4 = 32\)
   - Subject 2: \(7 \times 3 = 21\)
   - Subject 3: \(9 \times 3 = 27\)
   - Subject 4: \(6 \times 2 = 12\)
   - Subject 5: \(8 \times 3 = 24\)
   - Subject 6: \(7 \times 3 = 21\)
   - Subject 7: \(10 \times 1 = 10\)
   - Subject 8: \(9 \times 2 = 18\)

2. *Sum the results*:
   - \(32 + 21 + 27 + 12 + 24 + 21 + 10 + 18 = 165\)

3. *Sum the total credits*:
   - \(4 + 3 + 3 + 2 + 3 + 3 + 1 + 2 = 21\)

4. *Divide the total grade points by the total credits*:
   - SGPA = \(\frac{165}{21} \approx 7.86\)

### Output:
The calculated SGPA for the given grades and credits is approximatelyÂ 7.86.
